scikit-talk user documentation
==============================

Scikit-talk will be an open-source toolkit for processing collections of
real-world conversational speech in Python. The toolkit aims to facilitate the
exploration of large collections of transcriptions and annotations of
conversational interaction, specifically tailored to applications in speech
processing and Conversational AI.

Scikit-talk is under active development, and currently includes a preprocessor
module that allows the import of several common transcription formats.
